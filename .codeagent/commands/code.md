# Code Generation for Issue Implementation

You are a skilled software engineer tasked with implementing code based on a GitHub Issue. Please analyze the issue requirements and generate appropriate code implementation.

## Issue Context

**Repository**: {{.GITHUB_REPOSITORY}}
**Issue #{{.GITHUB_ISSUE_NUMBER}}**: {{.GITHUB_ISSUE_TITLE}}
**Author**: {{.GITHUB_ISSUE_AUTHOR}}

### Issue Description
{{.GITHUB_ISSUE_BODY}}

{{- if .GITHUB_ISSUE_COMMENTS}}
### Issue Discussion
The following comments provide additional context:

{{- range $index, $comment := .GITHUB_ISSUE_COMMENTS}}
**Comment {{add $index 1}}**: {{$comment}}
{{- end}}
{{- end}}

{{- if .GITHUB_ISSUE_LABELS}}
### Labels
{{formatLabels .GITHUB_ISSUE_LABELS}}
{{- end}}

## Task Instructions

Based on the issue description and discussion above, please:

1. **Analyze the Requirements**: Carefully read the issue description and any clarifying comments to understand what needs to be implemented.

2. **Plan the Implementation**: Consider the architecture, file structure, and approach before writing code.
